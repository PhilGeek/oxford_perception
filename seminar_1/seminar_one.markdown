# Introduction #

Cook Wilson's [CW] "Letter in criticism of a paper on Primary and Secondary Qualities" is addressed to G.F. Stout [GFS] and criticizes his paper "Primary and Secondary Qualities" that appeared in the *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*. The main object of CW's criticism's is GFS's commitment to a form of *indirect* or *representative* realism. It is notable though that CW does not describe himself as a direct realist. So any doubts about the distinction between direct and indirect objects of awareness of the kind that Austin raises in *Sense and Sensibilia* *may* not be applicable to CW.

*Indirect* or *representative* realism essentially involves a distinction between two ways in which something may figure as an object of experience--they may do so either directly or indirectly. Without denying that we see the external objects reported by our ordinary perceptual attributions, the indirect or representative realist claims that we do so only *indirectly*. The direct or immediate objects of experience are not the external objects reported by our ordinary perceptual judgments but some other, typically though not necessarily mental, intermediary.

Not only does CW oppose indirect or representative realism, but he questions whether it is a sustainable form of realism. He suspects that it will involve the postulation of Kantian things-in-themselves and will ultimately result in a form of realism.

## Reid's Two Questions ##

GFS's topic is set Thomas Reid:

> Everyone knows that extension, divisibility, figure, motion, solidity, hardness, softness, and fluidity were by Mr. Locke called primary qualities of body; and that sound colour taste, smell, and heat or cold were called secondary qualities. Is there a just foundation for this distinction? Is there anything common to the primary which belongs not to the secondary? And what is it?

According to GFS:

1. The distinction between PQs and SQs is "just".
2. There is more in common between PQs and SQs than is claimed by the Lockean view. Specifically, PQs and SQs are in one way dependent on sensation and in one way independent of sensation:
    * They are each dependent on sensation in that they inherit their qualitative character from the the character of the sensation but only insofar as that sensation is representative of something else.
    * They are each independent of sensation in that objects may instantiate PQs and SQs independently of being perceived.

More needs to be said about they way in with PQs and SQs are on a par, but there is a prior question. If PQs and SQs are metaphysically on a par, then how may they be distinguished? In pressing their commonality has GFS elided the distinction? According to GFS the PQ/SQ distinction is not a metaphysical distinction so much as it is an explanatory distinction. PQs figure in the statement of laws of nature in the way that SQs do not: "The executive order of the material world can be expressed only in terms of primary and not in terms of the secondary properties of matter."

## The Lockean View ##

In answering Reid's queries in the way that he does GFS takes himself to be in opposition to the standard Lockean view (understood broadly enough to include not only Locke but his modern followers).

According to GFS, the *Lockean view* maintains that:

1. PQs are qualities of external things, but
2. SQs are not, rather, they are qualities of sensations caused by external objects.

In so maintaining, the Lockean view convicts common sense of error. As ordinarily conceived SQs are qualities of external objects. All that the plain man ought to mean in attributing SQs to external objects is that they have the power to produce certain sensations in us in certain circumstances. Common sense is subject to a projective error: it conflates qualities of sensation with qualities of the external objects that cause these sensations. In GFS's term, the "flagrant absurdity" that sensations exist and change independently of anyone experiencing them.

A subsidiary aim of GFS's is  to argue that common sense is guilty of no such error and that in attributing SQs to external objects, the Plain Man means *more* than the body has a power to produce certain sensations in us.

CW, rightly to my mind, claims that GFS has mischaracterized the Lockean view. Two points: 

1. According to the Lockean view, SQs are not qualities of sensations, but are powers to produce sensations with a certain qualitative character in us.
2. It is not an essential commitment of the Lockean view that there is nothing corresponding to the sensation than the power to produce that sensation. There is, in addition, as we might put it, the categorical grounds of the disposition, the primary qualities that give rise to that power.

## Stout's Defense of the Plain Man ##

What's meant by ordinary SQ attributions?

1. Not that an external object is actually producing a sensation---we ascribe heat to an iron before we are in a position to feel it.
2. Not the power to produce sensations in us---that's merely part of what's meant.

Is the the Plain Man committed to the "flagrant absurdity" allegedly attributed to him by the Lockean View?

GFS makes two points:

1. The sensations which mediate knowledge of SQs do so only in so far as "they represent, express, or stand for something other than themselves."
2. Representative realism is an implicit commitment of common sense--the distinction between what's represented and the sense represenation is a latent presupposition of ordinary thought.

GFS thinks that we can come recognize our implicit commitment to the representative role of sensation by considering cases where sensation lack this role. The general idea is something like this: How do we distinguish a mere change in appearance from an appearance of change. Both involve a variation in appearance, so how can we distinguish these cases? GFS's idea is that they can be distinguished in terms of the circumstances of perception. A change in sensible appearance under certain circumstances represent changes in the thing perceived. In different circumstances, the change in sensible appearance lacks this representative function and so is a mere change in appearance. GFS's case, here, is nondemonstrative---it's best interpreted as taking the form of inference to the best explanation.

The case:

* The gradual diminuation and final discontinuance of heat sensations as a perceiver moves away from a heat source.

The argument:

* If the change in sensation had a "representative value" it would represent a change in the heat source. However, we don't regard the diminuation and final discontinuance of the sensation of heat as a change in the heat source but merely a change in its appearance.

CW observes that by GFS's own lights, the change has "representative value": "It obviously corresponds to the objective physical fact that the heat in the body has physical effects at a distance from itself and these effects diminish in intensity as the distance increases."

The upshot of the discussion of the 2 points:

1. SQs of matter are correlated but not identical with corresponding qualities of sensation.
2. Material objects may instantiate SQs independently of being perceived.
3. The qualitative character of SQs depend on and derive from the qualitative character of the corresponding sensations only insofar as they represent something other than themselves.

(1) and (3) interact: If SQs are distinct from sensations, PQs, and the powers to produce sensations that they give rise to, then what are they? And what must they be like if they are to inherit their qualitative character from the corresponding sensation? At at least two points GFS characterizes SQs as the "organic unity":

> What are called the secondary qualities of matter are not identified with what is represented in distinction from its sense-representation, nor yet with the sense-representation in distinction from what it stands for. It is rather the complex unity formed by both together and commonly left unanalyzed. (PSQ: 144-145)

Not at all sure what this means. Moreover, talk of "complex unity" seems to name the mystery rather than explain it. 

As we will see CW will be pressing GFS on related issues.

## Primary Qualities ##

PQs display the same pattern dependence and independence:

1. Material objects instantiate PQs independently of being perceived.
2. The qualitative character of PQs depend on and derive from the qualitative character of the corresponding sensations only insofar as they represent something other than themselves.

GFS's example is extension. Visual and tactile sensations of shape and size have qualitative character that correspond to the real extension that they represent. Compare: the qualitative character of the sensation of yellow corresponds to yellowness.

Why distinguish between *sensible extension* and *spatial* or *real extension*? Stout offers four reasons:

1. When we close our ideas we no longer see external bodies distributed in space. Nevertheless we experience a visual field. This field has distinguishable parts that stand in relations of position and distance to the other parts of a whole and constitute "a continuous extensive quantum". But the parts of the field which we can selectively attend to do not occupy an part of space. Perhaps the visual field corresponds to the extent of the retina. But the visual field depends not only on the retina but its anatomical structure. 
2. If the visual extension were real extension it would be coterminous with the outlying portions of space. It would thus have a shape, but it has no shape.
3. Visual extension and real extension are incommensurable---there is no common measure.
4. Real extension is public, but visual extension is private.

CW will criticize (1)-(3). He does not mention (4) presumably since after the criticisms of (1)-(3) the grounds for (4) are undermined.

## Preliminaries ##

CW begins with some preliminary remarks, which are interesting. Let me mention, without elaborating, just two. Both concern, as we would put it, ordinary language philosophy. 

The first is a methodological observation. GFS exaggerates the difference between the philosopher and the Plain Man: "As philosopher's we interrogate ourselves as plain men." 

The second concerns the difference between heat and color (or the difference between touch and sight, more generally). We speak of the sensation of heat but we never speak of the sensation of yellow. We feel hot but we do not feel yellow. Talk of color sensations is not a commitment of common sense but is theoretically motivated. Later it emerges that this is a linguistic manifestation of a phenomenological difference. It is partly for this reason that CW focuses on heat as opposed to color as a paradigm exemplar of an SQ.

Paul Snowdon queried the significance of CW's linguistic observation. The absence of the verb "feel" in ordinary perceptual reports of color does not mean that the perception of color involves no sensation. After all, we can *have* sensations as well as *feel* them. Perhaps the verb "feel" is restricted in its use to reporting certain types of sensations. 

## Representation ##

CW singles out for criticism GFS's claim that the sensations which mediate knowledge of SQs do so only in so far as "they represent, express, or stand for something other than themselves".

CW insists that talk of representation in philosophy is "loose and treacherous", a "trap word", and undertakes a "critique" of its meaning.

There are five main points:

1. Perhaps the most fundamental issue consists in a denial and a positive suggestion about the nature of representation. The denial consists in the claim that nothing is intrinsically representational: "Nothing has *meaning* in itself." The positive claim is put as follows: "Representation is our subjective act. \ldots\ It is *we* who mean." It is on these grounds that CW criticizes Bradley's theory of judgment (*Statement and Inference*, XIII, §§124-125). This thought, or something very much like it, independently animates McDowell in his discussion of Dennett and Travis in his discussion of the representational theory of experience. While this is really the fundamental point, CW doesn't stress it in his critique of GFS. Nor does he explicitly argue for it, either in the present letter or in the manuscript about Bradley's theory of judgement. 

Rory Madden observed that there are two ways in which the slogan "It is we who mean" might be understood:

* Perhaps representation is *personal* in the sense that it belongs to a conscious subject.
* Perhaps represenation is *agential* in the sense that its the result of something a person does.

The distinction potentially bears on whether CK's criticism generalizes to encompass, not only representative realism, but the representational theory of experience (understood not as an explanatory hypothesis about the phenomenal character of experience of the kind that Harman endorses but as merely the attribution to experience of representational content.) Perhaps, an agential conception of representation, if developed and sustained, would count against the representational theory of experience (but see McDowell's remarks about spontaneity); but it is unobvious that a personal conception of represenation would. Experiences are, after all, states of a subject (conrast subpersonal states of a subject such as neurophysiological states). Perhaps that is enough to satisfy the constraints imposed by a personal conception of representation. The matter is unclear. It all depends on how much must be built into the notion of personal representation. If it is a more demanding notion, then more would have to be said in defense of this more demanding notion.

Without settling on a specific interpretation of the slogan "It is *we* who mean", I will henceforth refer to the general class of views as personal conceptions of represntation.

2. CW draws a distinction between two natural relations that ground different notions of representation.
    * A may represent B because A resembles B (mimetic representation)
    * A may represent B because the existence of A necessitates the existence of B (factive representation)

Paul Snowdon wondered how this could be consistent with the fundamental point that it is *we* who mean, since these are natural relations which can obtain independently of a subject. The distinction could not consist thereby in two analyses of different notions of representation, since the resulting conceptions of representation would be impersonal. Perhaps mimesis and necessary covariation are natural relations that merely incline us to represent things by means of them. Perhaps they are merely relations whose obtaining can be exploited by a person's representational ends. Something like this is suggested by the following passage:

> It is we who make the weeping willow a symbol of sorrow. There may of course be something in the object which prompts us to give it a meaning, e.g., the resemblance of the weeping willow to a human figure bowed over in the attitude of grief. But the willow in itself can neither 'mean' grief, nor 'represent' nor 'stand for' nor 'express' grief. We do all that.

The resemblance of the weeping willow to a human figure bowed over in the attitude of grief is thus not *sufficient* for the former to represent the latter (and so mimesis is not an analysis of a kind of representation), though it may incline us to take the former to represent the latter.

Paul Snowdon also wondered whether in taking personal representation as the fundamental notion whether CK was eliding the Gricean distinction between natural and non-natural meaning. The natural presentation relations of mimesis and necessary covariation are, after all, candidates for being Gricean natural meaning, but CK seems to deny that they are representations of any sort in the absence of use by a person. 

If all Grice means by natural meaning is an information-bearing state (in a sense of information that precludes misinformation), then A's resembling or necesssarily covarying with B suffices for A to naturally mean B. CK's point would then be that these natural relations are insufficient for a notion of representation that leaves room for the possibility of error, of misinformation. 

Paul Snowdon suggests that this dialectic reveals a lacuna in CK's case. Perhaps representation *in a particular sense* is personal and so liable to misrepresentaiton. But Ck is not acknowledging any restriction in the use of represention but is singling out, without explicit justification, one sense of representation as fundamental.

3. CW emphasizes the symmetry of these relations. If A resembles B in some respect, B resembles A in that respect. If A necessarily covaries with B, B necessarily covaries with B. This undermines the asymmetry between GFS's talk of a sense representation and what it represents. Or rather, if that asymmetry is sustained, this is evidence of a further assumption in play. Specifically, if A represents B without B representing A this is because A but not B is "present to consciousness."

One worry is whether CK has specified the hidden assumption in a non-question-begging manner. Shouldn't it rather be "immediately present to consciousness"? At least by the lights of a representative realist such as Stout?

Lee Walters observes that in the specification (above and in CK's text) of the natural relation involved in factive representation, the relation is described as "necessitation". But there is a good sense of necessitation in which it is not symmetric. That's certainly true, but CK's repeated emphasis on the symmetry of the relation is evidence that by "necessitates" he means the symmetric relation of necessary covariation. It was also observed that the fative nature of the relation does not require the modal element nor does the symmetry of the relation require that it be factive (it might be a symmetrical statistical relation of some sort).

Paul Snowdon points out how the personal conception of representation is at work her in CK's reflections on symmetry. Suppose that Stout is working with an impersonal notion of representation (though he shouldn't, at least by Cook Wilson's lights). IF Stout is working with an impersonal notion of representation then the the external world could (impersonally) represent the sensation, it is just not a relation that anyone could exploit.

4. CW doubts that the relevant notion of representation could be mimetic. Two arguments:
    1. In feeling the shape of a thing, we have feelings distinct from extension and yet is through these feelings that we become aware of the thing's shape. Here tactile sensation mediates our knowledge of extension. But talk of mediation implies that that the tactile sensations differ from extension and so they cannot be representative by means of resemblance.

There is a potential lacuna in this argument. That tactile sensation mediates our knowledge of extension may establish that sensation and extension are numerically distinct, but it does not follow from numerical distinctness that the sensation could not mimetically represent extension. To establish that, we would need the stronger claim that sensation and extension differ in kind. If sensation and extension are unlike in kind then there would be no mimetic relation in virtue of which a person could represent the latter by the former.

It is unlikely that Cook Wilson conflates numerical distinction with distinction in kind since he repeatedly emphasizes this difference in other contexts and commends due attention to it to Stout. So what bridges the gap in the argument? Is CK simply helping himself to the Berkelean argument (in which case we do not have two arguments but two variants of the same argument.)

Paul Snowdon suggests that what bridges the gap is a phenomenological claim---that there is nothing in sensation that is spatial. Perhaps the following is the statement of the alleged phenomenological claim:

> Here (in felt extension) we seem to recognize in feeling round the surfaces and edges of a die (e.g.) that we hace certain feelings quite different from the extension, and yet that it is somehow *through* these feelings that we become aware of the extension.

But if the argument turns on this phenomenological claim, why should Stout accept it? Perhaps Cook Wilson things that this is the closest and most specific claim about the relevant phenomenology in the area, and that it is simply not going to do for Stout's purposes.
    2. The Berkelean argument: Only a sensation can resemble a sensation. So if representation were mimetic, the Plain Man would be guilty of the "flagrant absurdity".
5. If we consider sensations as representative this must be so either on the grounds of likeness or covariation with extension. We must already be acquainted with the likeness or know the covariation. But this is impossible if the mediation of our knowledge of extension by sensation means that we depend on such sensations for our knowledge of extension.

How plausible is the operative epistemological premise? Advocates of certain forms of naturalized semantics such as Fodor's correlational psychosemantics would deny any such epistemic assumption. So would reliabilists like Goldman. What confers justification on belief is that it is formed by a reliable belief forming mechanism, not that we know that it is so formed. Are they justified in doing so? What does this tell us about CW's argument.

I suspect that here too, the personal conception of representation is at work, at least implicitly. They hypothesis is that the restriction that we should know of the relevant natural relations flows form the thought that it is only if we know of such relations that we could exploit them for our representational ends.

How are we to understand CW's claim:

> Not it follows, from the above analysis of such meaning as 'representative' can have, that the quality of a representative sensation cannot possibly enter 'in consequence of tis representative function' into 'the essential constitution of the corresponding secondary attributes of matter'. Just because of 'its representative function' it can do nothing of the kind, and the statement is a mere contradiction in terms.

## Visual Extension ##

### Critique of Stout ###

Concerning GFS's distinction between visual extension and real extension CW makes four sets of remarks:

1. Given the Berkelean reasoning, visual extension represents something unlike itself, so real extension differs in kind from any figure that is presented to us in perception or visual imagination. What, then, is real extension? We cannot say. GFS is "committed to something worse even than a 'thing in itself', viz., to 'an attribute in itself".
2. That real extension is of the same kind as visual extension presupposed by the science of geometry. Just as there could be no science of a thing in itself, there could be no science of extension of itself.
3. The phenomenological difference between heat and color. The sensation of heat is felt in the affected part of the body. We experience color, in contrast, as clearly and distinctly located in the perceived external object. (This is the phenomenological difference that is reflected in ordinary language.) It follows that color cannot be representative of extension because we cannot perceive it except as extended---as inhering in an extended surface. Nor can we imagine otherwise. If we perceive color, we must perceive at the same time extension. CW supports this by observing that if we perceive adjacent homogenous colors we necessarily perceive their boundary.
4. "But the important thing now is the extension element in this; because it is as *extended* sensation, or visual *extension*, that you can make it '*representative*' of something in the body---apparent and not real, and, as it would seem, something merely subjective."

The conclusion: Sensations are not extended and the idea of extension is *absolutely inapplicable* to them.

### Apparent and Real Size ###

CW claims that GFS gets confused about visual extension because of his understanding of the distinction between real and apparent size. 

CW's methodology here anticipates Austin:

> Just as 'representative and represented' so 'real and apparent' seem to me regular trap words, which cannot be safely used in any particular case without a most patient examination of their meaning and justification in the particular instance.

CW makes negative and positive remarks about real and apparent size.

#### Negative Remarks ####

1. GFS's theory seems committed to a form of subjective idealism:
    1. Sensible extension is not real extension since real extension is in space but sensible extension is not. (By hypothesis, for the sake of reductio)
    2. Things appear extended in space.
    3. The space in which things appear extend is not real.
    4. This seems to be committed to a form of subjective idealism.
2. CW's strategy is to argue against GFS's claim that real and apparent size are incommensurable and then to draw out some implausible consequences from what remains of his view. First apparent size and real size must be commensurable. If apparent size is a *size*, it has a measure. There must then be a common measure between real and apparent size. This seems implausible. The reasoning overgeneralizes. There would be no incommensurable measures, but there are. CW however has an interesting subsidiary argument. How do we measure the real extension of a line. Well, you use a ruler. But by hypothesis it is the merely apparent extension of the ruler which is given in experience. You might think that we apply the visual extension of the ruler to the apparent line. But this presupposes that real extensions are in the same ratio to one another as apparent extensions. (And hence real and apparent size are commensurable.) But, further, how do we know that real and apparent extension are in proportion since real extensions are never the objects of perception. Supposing that real and apparent size are commensurable. Since apparent size varies with distance there must be some distance in which real and apparent size coincide. But what distance is that? 

#### Positive Remarks ####

Two things can be equal in size and yet one can look smaller than the other because it is further from the viewer than the other. How are we to understand the sense in which it "looks smaller". CW is, at this point, satisfied that understanding the apparent size of the thing cannot be understood as something which is both subjective and the object of experience. He thus seeks to understand the thing's looking smaller as some objective feature of the thing by drawing on some elementary features of classical perspective. Indeed his account turns on the observation that motivates classical perspective---that we cannot see around colors. "The observer sees a point in the real extesnion of a real object in the direction (real) of the line drawn from his eye in real space to the given point in the real object"

### A Confusion about Appearance
